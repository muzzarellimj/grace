# Requirements

1. As a book collector, I want an online platform to track books I have in my collection so that I can keep better track of what I do not own.
    - This platform should be connected to an online database, Firestore, to store tracked books persistently.

2. As a book collector, I want to see a quick overview of the books I have added to my collection so that I can quickly understand the books that I already own.
    - This overview should present a condensed view of all books in a collection in a scrollable window.

3. As a book collector, I want to be able to add a book to my collection with an ISBN so that I can scan physical books into my online collection.

4. As a book collector, I want to see more details about books in my collection so I can better understand finer metadata about each book.

5. As a book collector, I want to access this platform both on my desktop computer and mobile device so that I can track my collection on the go.
